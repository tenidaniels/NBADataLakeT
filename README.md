# NBADataLake
This repository contains the setup_nba_data_lake.py script, which automates the creation of a data lake for NBA analytics using AWS services. The script integrates Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Athena, and sets up the infrastructure needed to store and query NBA-related data.

# Overview
The setup_nba_data_lake.py script performs the following actions:

Creates an Amazon S3 bucket to store raw and processed data.
Uploads sample NBA data (JSON format) to the S3 bucket.
Creates an AWS Glue database and an external table for querying the data.
Configures Amazon Athena for querying data stored in the S3 bucket.

# Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

Go to Sportsdata.io and create a free account
At the top left, you should see "Developers", if you hover over it you should see "API Resources"
Click on "Introduction & Testing"
Click on "SportsDataIO API Free Trial" and fill out the information & be sure to select NBA for this tutorial
You will get an email and at the bottom it says "Launch Developer Portal"
By default it takes you to the NFL, on the left click on NBA
Scroll down until you see "Standings"
You'll "Query String Parameters", the value in the drop down box is your API key. 
Copy this string because you will need to paste it later in the script

IAM Role/Permissions: Ensure the user or role running the script has the following permissions:

S3: s3:CreateBucket, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteBucket, s3:ListBucket
Glue: glue:CreateDatabase, glue:CreateTable, glue:DeleteDatabase, glue:DeleteTable
Athena: athena:StartQueryExecution, athena:GetQueryResults
